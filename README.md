# Creating Presentation Slides with Jupyter notebook

Please see [blog post](http://echorand.me/presentation-slides-with-jupyter-notebook.html#.V19WnWJ96V4) on how I created my first slide deck with Jupyer Notebook.

# Specific steps:

To setup:  

    git clone https://github.com/cajalcourse/2019_restingstate_project.git  
    cd 2019_restingstate_project  

Move your notebook into repo:  

    mv [notebook.ipynb] project.ipynb  

Convert to slides and push to repo:  

    ./publish.sh  

Then go to [https://cajalcourse.github.io/2019_restingstate_project](https://cajalcourse.github.io/2019_restingstate_project) to view slideshow
